DGETRS solves a system of linear equations
   A * X = B  or  A' * X = B with a general N-by-N matrix A using the
LU factorization computed by DGETRF.


Arguments
=========

TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
        Specifies the form of the system of equations:

        = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)

        = 'T':  A'* X = B  (Transpose)

        = 'C':  A'* X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

NRHS    (input) INTEGER
        The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
        of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
        The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
        as computed by DGETRF.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
        The pivot indices from DGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
        matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
        On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
        On exit, the solution matrix X.

LDB     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
