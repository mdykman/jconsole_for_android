DTREXC reorders the real Schur factorization of a real matrix A =
Q*T*Q**T, so that the diagonal block of T with row index IFST is moved
to row ILST.

The real Schur form T is reordered by an orthogonal similarity
transformation Z**T*T*Z, and optionally the matrix Q of Schur vectors
is updated by postmultiplying it with Z.


T must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that is,
block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each
2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.


Arguments
=========

COMPQ   (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'V':  update the matrix Q of Schur vectors;

        = 'N':  do not update Q.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.

T       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDT,N)
        On entry, the upper quasi-triangular matrix T, in Schur
        Schur canonical form.
        On exit, the reordered upper quasi-triangular matrix, again
        in Schur canonical form.

LDT     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).

Q       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ,N)
        On entry, if COMPQ = 'V', the matrix Q of Schur vectors.
        On exit, if COMPQ = 'V', Q has been postmultiplied by the
        orthogonal transformation matrix Z which reorders T.
        If COMPQ = 'N', Q is not referenced.

LDQ     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array Q.  LDQ >= max(1,N).

IFST    (input/output) INTEGER


ILST    (input/output) INTEGER
        Specify the reordering of the diagonal blocks of T.
        The block with row index IFST is moved to row ILST, by a
        sequence of transpositions between adjacent blocks.
        On exit, if IFST pointed on entry to the second row of a
        2-by-2 block, it is changed to point to the first row; ILST
        always points to the first row of the block in its final
        position (which may differ from its input value by +1 or -1).
        1 <= IFST <= N; 1 <= ILST <= N.

WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)


INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        = 1:  two adjacent blocks were too close to swap (the problem
        is very ill-conditioned); T may have been partially
        reordered, and ILST points to the first row of the
        current position of the block being moved.
