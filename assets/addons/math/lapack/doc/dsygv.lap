DSYGV computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x. Here A and B
are assumed to be symmetric and B is also

positive definite.


Arguments
=========

ITYPE   (input) INTEGER
        Specifies the problem type to be solved:

        = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x

        = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x

        = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x

JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1

        = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;

        = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1

        = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
        On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
        leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
        upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
        the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
        the lower triangular part of the matrix A.

        On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
        matrix Z of eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors are normalized
        as follows:
        if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
        if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.
        If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the upper triangle (if UPLO='U')
        or the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') of A, including the
        diagonal, is destroyed.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB, N)
        On entry, the symmetric matrix B.  If UPLO = 'U', the
        leading N-by-N upper triangular part of B contains the
        upper triangular part of the matrix B.  If UPLO = 'L',
        the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of B contains
        the lower triangular part of the matrix B.

        On exit, if INFO <= N, the part of B containing the matrix is
        overwritten by the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
        factorization B = U**T*U or B = L*L**T.

LDB     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LWORK)
        On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK   (input) INTEGER
        The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N-1).
        For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+2)*N,
        where NB is the blocksize for DSYTRD returned by ILAENV.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  DPOTRF or DSYEV returned an error code:

        <= N:  if INFO = i, DSYEV failed to converge;
        i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
        tridiagonal form did not converge to zero;
        > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then the leading
        minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
        The factorization of B could not be completed and
        no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
