DSTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
symmetric tridiagonal matrix using the implicit QL or QR method. The
eigenvectors of a full or band symmetric matrix can also be found if
DSYTRD or DSPTRD or DSBTRD has been used to reduce this matrix to
tridiagonal form.


Arguments
=========

COMPZ   (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.

        = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original
        symmetric matrix.  On entry, Z must contain the
        orthogonal matrix used to reduce the original matrix
        to tridiagonal form.
        = 'I':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
        tridiagonal matrix.  Z is initialized to the identity
        matrix.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.

D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        On entry, the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
        On exit, if INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

E       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
        On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
        matrix.
        On exit, E has been destroyed.

Z       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, N)
        On entry, if  COMPZ = 'V', then Z contains the orthogonal
        matrix used in the reduction to tridiagonal form.
        On exit, if INFO = 0, then if  COMPZ = 'V', Z contains the
        orthonormal eigenvectors of the original symmetric matrix,
        and if COMPZ = 'I', Z contains the orthonormal eigenvectors
        of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
        If COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.

LDZ     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
        eigenvectors are desired, then  LDZ >= max(1,N).

WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(1,2*N-2))
        If COMPZ = 'N', then WORK is not referenced.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  the algorithm has failed to find all the eigenvalues in
        a total of 30*N iterations; if INFO = i, then i
        elements of E have not converged to zero; on exit, D
        and E contain the elements of a symmetric tridiagonal
        matrix which is orthogonally similar to the original
        matrix.
