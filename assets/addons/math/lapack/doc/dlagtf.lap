DLAGTF factorizes the matrix (T - lambda*I), where T is an n by n
tridiagonal matrix and lambda is a scalar, as

where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower tridiagonal matrix
with at most one non-zero sub-diagonal elements per column and U is an
upper triangular matrix with at most two non-zero super-diagonal
elements per column.


The factorization is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial
pivoting and implicit row scaling.


The parameter LAMBDA is included in the routine so that DLAGTF may be
used, in conjunction with DLAGTS, to obtain eigenvectors of T by
inverse iteration.


Arguments
=========

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix T.

A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        On entry, A must contain the diagonal elements of T.

        On exit, A is overwritten by the n diagonal elements of the
        upper triangular matrix U of the factorization of T.

LAMBDA  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
        On entry, the scalar lambda.

B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
        On entry, B must contain the (n-1) super-diagonal elements of
        T.

        On exit, B is overwritten by the (n-1) super-diagonal
        elements of the matrix U of the factorization of T.

C       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
        On entry, C must contain the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements of
        T.

        On exit, C is overwritten by the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements
        of the matrix L of the factorization of T.

TOL     (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
        On entry, a relative tolerance used to indicate whether or
        not the matrix (T - lambda*I) is nearly singular. TOL should
        normally be chose as approximately the largest relative error
        in the elements of T. For example, if the elements of T are
        correct to about 4 significant figures, then TOL should be
        set to about 5*10**(-4). If TOL is supplied as less than eps,
        where eps is the relative machine precision, then the value
        eps is used in place of TOL.

D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-2)
        On exit, D is overwritten by the (n-2) second super-diagonal
        elements of the matrix U of the factorization of T.

IN      (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
        On exit, IN contains details of the permutation matrix P. If
        an interchange occurred at the kth step of the elimination,
        then IN(k) = 1, otherwise IN(k) = 0. The element IN(n)
        returns the smallest positive integer j such that

        abs( u(j,j) ).le. norm( (T - lambda*I)(j) )*TOL,

        where norm( A(j) ) denotes the sum of the absolute values of
        the jth row of the matrix A. If no such j exists then IN(n)
        is returned as zero. If IN(n) is returned as positive, then a
        diagonal element of U is small, indicating that
        (T - lambda*I) is singular or nearly singular,

INFO    (output)
        = 0   : successful exit

        .lt. 0: if INFO = -k, the kth argument had an illegal value
