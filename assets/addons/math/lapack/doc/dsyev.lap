DSYEV computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a real
symmetric matrix A.


Arguments
=========

JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;

        = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1

        = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
        On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
        leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
        upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
        the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
        the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
        On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
        orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A.
        If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the lower triangle (if UPLO='L')
        or the upper triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the
        diagonal, is destroyed.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LWORK)
        On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK   (input) INTEGER
        The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N-1).
        For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+2)*N,
        where NB is the blocksize for DSYTRD returned by ILAENV.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i
        off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal
        form did not converge to zero.
