DPOCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a real symmetric positive definite matrix using the
Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T computed by DPOTRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
        The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
        A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by DPOTRF.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
        The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the symmetric matrix A.

RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
        computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
        estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)


IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)


INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
