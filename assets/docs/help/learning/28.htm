<H1>Chapter 28: Data Files</H1>
The subject of file-handling in general, and how data is
organized in files, is a major topic in itself.
In this chapter we will cover only a selection of the facilities
available in J.
<p>
J functions to read files produce results in the form
of character-strings, and similarly functions to write files take strings 
as arguments.
Such a string can be the whole data content of a file when the available 
memory of the computer
is sufficient.  
<p>
Our approach here will be 
to look first at some J functions for input
and output of strings. Then we look at a few examples of dealing with  
strings as representing data in various formats. Finally 
we look at mapped files as an alternative to conventional
file-handling.
<A NAME="02"></A>
<H2>28.1  Reading and Writing Files</H2>
<H3>28.1.1  Built-in Verbs</H3>
In the following, a filename is a string which is valid as a filename
for the operating-system of the computer where we are running J.
For example:
<PRE>
   F =: 'c:\temp\demofile.xyz'       NB. a filename
</PRE>
The built-in verb <TT>1!:2</TT> writes data to a 
file. The right argument is a boxed filename. The left argument is a 
character-string, the data to be written.
The effect is that the file is created if it does not already exist, and 
the data becomes the whole content of the file.
The result is null. 
<PRE>
   'some data' 1!:2 < F    NB. write to file F
</PRE>
The built-in verb <TT>1!:1</TT> reads data from a file. 
The right argument is a boxed filename. The result
is a character-string, the data read. 
<PRE>
   data =: 1!:1 < F     NB.  read from file F
</PRE>

<p>
<H3>28.1.2  Screen and Keyboard As Files</H3>
Screen and keyboard can be treated as files, to provide
a simple facility for user-interaction with
a running program.
<p>
The expression <TT>x (1!:2) 2</TT> writes the value of <TT>x</TT> to "file 2",
that is, to the screen. 
A verb to display to the screen can be written as
<PRE>
   display =: (1!:2) & 2
</PRE>
<A NAME="03"></A>
For example, here is a verb to display the stages 
in the computation of least-common-denominator by Euclid's
algorithm.
<PRE>
   E =: 4 : 0
display x , y
if. y = 0 do. x else. (x | y) E x end.
)
   
   12 E 15
12 15
3 12
0 3
3 0
3
</PRE>
<A NAME="04"></A>
The value to be displayed by <TT>(1!:2) &2</TT> is not limited to strings:
in the example above a list of numbers was displayed.
<p>
User-input can be requested from the keyboard by reading "file 1", that is,
by evaluating  <TT>(1!:1) 1</TT>. 
The result is a character-string containing the user's keystrokes.
For example, a function for user-interaction might be:
<PRE>
   ui =: 3 : 0
display 'please type your name:' 
n  =.  (1!:1) 1
display 'thank you ', n
''
)
</PRE>
and then after executing
<PRE>
         ui ''
</PRE>
a dialogue appears on the screen,  like this:
<PRE>
       please type your name:
</PRE>
<PRE>
       Waldo
</PRE>
<PRE>
       thank you Waldo
</PRE>

<H3>28.1.3  Library Verbs</H3>
There are a number of useful verbs for file-handling in the "standard library" (<A HREF="26.htm">Chapter 26</A>). 
Here is a brief summary of a selection:
<p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=4>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TT> s fwrite  F</TT> </TD>
    <TD> write string s to file F</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TT>   fread   F</TT></TD>
    <TD> read string from  file F</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TT> s fappend F</TT></TD >
    <TD> append string s to file F </TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TT>   fread F;B,L</TT></TD>
    <TD> read slice from file F, starting at B, length L</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TT> s fwrites F </TT></TD>
    <TD> write text s to file F</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TT>   freads  F</TT></TD>
    <TD> read text from file F</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TT>   fexist  F</TT></TD> 
    <TD> true if file F exists</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TT>   ferase  F</TT></TD>
    <TD> delete file F</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
From now on we will use these library verbs for our file-handling.
<p>
The library verb <TT>fwrite</TT> writes data to a 
file. The right argument is a filename. The left argument is a 
character-string, the data to be written.
The effect is that the file is created if it does not already exist, and 
the data becomes the whole content of the file.
<PRE>
   'some data' fwrite F    NB. file write
9
</PRE>
The result shows the number of characters written.
A result of <TT>_1</TT> shows an error: either 
the left argument is not a string or 
the right argument
is not valid as a filename, or
the specified file exists but is read-only.
<PRE>
   (3;4) fwrite F
_1
</PRE>
The library verb <TT>fread</TT> reads data from  
file. 
The argument is a filename and the result
is a character-string. 
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>

<p>
A result of <TT>_1</TT> shows an error: the specified
file does not exist, or is locked.

</TABLE>
<p>
<p>
<A NAME="06"></A>
<H2>28.2  Large Files</H2>
For large files, the memory of the computer may not be sufficient to 
allow the file
to be treated as a single string. We look at this case very briefly. 
<p>
Write a file with some initial content:
<PRE>
   'abcdefgh' fwrite F
8
</PRE>
<A NAME="07"></A>
We can append some data to the file with library verb <TT>fappend</TT>.
<PRE>
   'MORE' fappend F
4
</PRE>
To see the effect of <TT>fappend</TT> (just for this demonstration, but not of
 course for a large file)
we can read the whole file again :
<PRE>
   fread F
abcdefghMORE
</PRE>
We can read a selected slice of the file, say 8 bytes starting from byte 
<TT>4</TT>. In this case
we use <TT>fread</TT> with a right argument of the form <TT>filename;start,size</TT>.
<PRE>
   start =: 4
   size  =: 8
   fread F ; start, size
efghMORE
</PRE>
<A NAME="08"></A>
<H2>28.3  Data Formats</H2>
We look now at a few examples of how data may be organized 
in a file, that is, represented by a string. Hence we look at converting
 between character strings, 
with various internal structures, and J variables. 
<p>
We take it that files are read and written for the purpose of exchanging 
data between 
programs. Two such programs we can call "writer" and "reader". Questions 
which arise
include:
<OL>
<LI> Are writer and reader both to be J programs? 
    If so, then there is a convenient J-only format, the "binary representation" covered below.
    If not, then we expect to work from a programming-language-independent
 description
    of the data. 
<p>
<LI> Are writer and reader to run on computers with the same architecture? 
    If not, then even in the J-to-J situation, some finesse may be needed.
<p>
<LI>Is the data organized entirely as a repetition of some structure 
    (for example, "fixed length records").
    If so then we may usefully be able to treat it as one or more J 
arrays. 
    If not, we may need some ad-hoc programming.
</OL>
<p>
<A NAME="09"></A>
<H3>28.3.1  The Binary Representation for J-0nly Files</H3>
Suppose we aim to handle certain files 
only in J programs, so that 
we are free to choose any file format convenient for
the J programmer. The "binary representation" is particularly
convenient.
<p>
For any array <TT>A</TT>,
<PRE>
   A =:  'Thurs'; 19 4 2001 
</PRE>
the binary representation of <TT>A</TT> is a character string.
There are built-in verbs to convert between
arrays and binary representations of arrays.
<PRE>
   arrbin  =: 3!:1   NB. array to binary rep.
   binarr  =: 3!:2   NB. binary rep. to array
</PRE>
If <TT>B</TT> is the binary representation of <TT>A</TT>, we see that <TT>B</TT> is
a character string, with a certain length.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>A</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>$ B =: arrbin A</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>+-----+---------+<BR>
|Thurs|19 4 2001|<BR>
+-----+---------+</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>88</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
We can write <TT>B</TT> to a file, read it back, 
and do the inverse conversion to recover the value of <TT>A</TT> :
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>B fwrite F </TT></TD>
<TD><TT>$ Z =: fread F</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>binarr Z</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>

<TD><TT>88</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>+-----+---------+<BR>
|Thurs|19 4 2001|<BR>
+-----+---------+</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
From J4.06 on, there are variations
of the binary representation verbs above
to allow for different machine architectures: 
see the Dictionary under <TT>3!:1</TT>.
<A NAME="10"></A>
<H3>28.3.2  Text Files</H3>
The expression <TT>a.</TT> (lower-case a dot)
is a built-in noun, a character-string 
containing all 256 ASCII characters in sequence.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>65 66 67 { a.</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>$ a.</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>ABC</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>256</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
In the ASCII character set, that is, in <TT>a.</TT>,  
the character at position 0 is the null,
at position 10 is line-feed and at position 13
is carriage return . In J, the names <TT>CR</TT> and <TT>LF</TT> 
are predefined in the standard profile to mean
the carriage-return and linefeed characters.
<PRE>
   a. i. CR,LF
13 10
</PRE>
We saw <TT>fread</TT> and <TT>fwrite</TT> used for reading and writing
character files. 
Text files are a special kind
of character file, in that lines are delimited by <TT>CR</TT> and/or <TT>LF</TT> 
characters.
<p>
On some systems the convention is that
lines of text are delimited by a single <TT>LF</TT>
and on other systems a <TT>CR,LF</TT> pair is expected.
Regardless of the system on which J is running, for J text variables, 
the convention is always followed of delimiting a line
with single <TT>LF</TT> and no <TT>CR</TT>. 
<p>
Here is an example of a text variable. 
<PRE>
   t =: 0 : 0
There is physics
and there is 
stamp-collecting.
)
</PRE>
Evidently it is a string 
(that is, a 1-dimensional character list) 
with 3 <TT>LF</TT> characters and no <TT>CR</TT> characters.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>$ t</TT></TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>49</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>3</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>0</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
If we aim to write this text variable <TT>t</TT> to
a text file, we must choose between the
 single-<TT>LF</TT> or <TT>CRLF</TT> conventions. 
There are two useful library verbs, <TT>fwrites</TT> and <TT>freads</TT>
to deal with this situation.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>
Under Windows, <TT>x fwrites y</TT>  
writes text-variable <TT>x</TT> to file <TT>y</TT>,
in the process converting each <TT>LF</TT> 
in <TT>x</TT> to a <TT>CRLF</TT> pair
in <TT>y</TT>. 
<LI>
Under Linux, <TT>x fwrites y</TT> 
writes text-variable <TT>x</TT> to file <TT>y</TT>,
with no conversion. 
<LI>
Under Windows or Linux
 <TT>z =: freads y</TT>
reads file <TT>y</TT>, converting any <TT>CRLF</TT>
pair in <TT>y</TT> to a single <TT>LF</TT> in text-variable <TT>z</TT>.
</UL>
<p>
For convenience in dealing with a text variable such as <TT>t</TT>, 
we can cut it into lines. A verb for this purpose
is <TT>cut</TT> (described more fully in <A HREF="17.htm">Chapter 17</A> ). 
<PRE>
   cut =: < ;. _2
</PRE>
<TT>cut</TT> produces a boxed list of lines, removing the <TT>LF</TT> 
at the end of each line.
<PRE>
   lines =: cut t
   lines
+----------------+-------------+-----------------+
|There is physics|and there is |stamp-collecting.|
+----------------+-------------+-----------------+
</PRE>
The inverse of <TT>cut</TT> we can call <TT>uncut</TT>. It restores the <TT>LF</TT>
at the end of each box and then razes to make a string.
<PRE>
   uncut =: ; @: (,&LF &. >)
   uncut lines
There is physics
and there is 
stamp-collecting.

</PRE>
<p>

<H3>28.3.3  Fixed Length Records with Binary Data</H3>
Suppose our data is in two J variables: a table <TT>cnames</TT>, of customer-names,
and a list <TT>amts</TT> in customer order with for each customer an amount, a balance say.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>cnames =: 'Mr Rochester' ,: 'Jane'</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>,. amts =: _10000 3</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>Mr Rochester<BR>
Jane</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>_10000<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Now suppose the aim is to write this data to a file, 
formatted in 16-byte records. 
Each record is to have two fields: customer-name in 12 bytes
followed by amount in 4 bytes, as a signed integer. 
Here is a possible approach.
<p>
The plan is to construct, from <TT>cnames</TT> and <TT>amts</TT>,
an n-by-16 character table, to be called <TT>records</TT>.
For this example, <TT>n=2</TT>, and <TT>records</TT> will look like this:
<PRE>
Mr Rochester####
Jane        ####
   
</PRE>
where <TT>####</TT> represents the 4 characters of
an integer in binary form.
<p>
We build the <TT>records</TT> table by stitching together side by
side an n-by-12 table for the customer names field, and an 
n-by-4 table for the amounts field.
<p>
For the customer-names field we already have <TT>cnames</TT> which is suitable, 
since it is 12 bytes wide:
<PRE>
   $ cnames
2 12
</PRE>
For the amounts field we convert <TT>amts</TT> to 
characters, using <TT>ci4</TT> from <A HREF="27.htm">Chapter 27</A>. 
The result is a single string,
which is reshaped to be n-by-4.
<PRE>
   ci4 =:  2 & (3!:4)  NB. integer to 4 char
   
   amtsfield =: ((# amts) , 4) $ ci4 amts
</PRE>
Now we build the n-by-16 <TT>records</TT> table by stitching together
side-by-side the two "field" tables:
<PRE>
   records =: cnames ,. amtsfield
</PRE>
To inspect <TT>records</TT>,
here is a utility verb which shows a non-printing
character as <TT>#</TT>
<PRE>
   inspect =: 3 : ('A=.a.{~32+i.96';'(A i.y) { A,''#''')
   
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>inspect records</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>$ records</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>Mr Rochester####<BR>
Jane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;####</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>2 16</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
The outgoing string to be written to the file is the ravel of the records.
<PRE>
   (, records) fwrite F
32
</PRE>
The inverse of the process is to recover J variables from the file. We 
read the file to get the incoming
string. 
<PRE>
   instr =: fread F
</PRE>
Since the record-length is known to be 16, the number of records is
<PRE>
   NR =: (# instr) % 16
</PRE>
Reshape the incoming string to get the <TT>records</TT> table.
<PRE>
   inspect records =: (NR,16) $ instr
Mr Rochester####
Jane        ####
</PRE>
and extract the data. The customer-names are obtained directly, as columns
 0-11 of <TT>records</TT>.
<PRE>
   cnames =: (i.12) {"1 records
</PRE>
For the amounts, we extract columns 12-15, ravel into a single string and 
convert to integers with <TT>c4i</TT>.
<PRE>
   c4i =: _2 & (3!:4)  NB. 4 char  to integer
   
   amts   =: c4i  , (12+i.4) {"1  records

<H2>28.4  Mapped Files</H2>
A file is said to be mapped when 
the file is temporarily incorporated
into the virtual-address-translation mechanism 
of an executing program. 
The data in a mapped file 
appears to the J programmer directly as the value of a 
J variable - an array. 
Changes to the value of the variable
 are changes to the data in the file. 
<p>
In such a case, we can say, for present purposes, 
that the file is mapped to the variable or, 
equivalently, that the variable is mapped to the file. 
<p>
Mapped files offer the following
advantages: 
<UL><LI>
 Convenience. Data in a file is handled
    just like data in any J array. There is no
    reading or writing of the file.
<p>
<LI> Persistent variables. A variable mapped to  
    a file lives in the file, and
    can persist from one J session to another.
</UL>
<p>
There are two cases.
In the first case, any kind of existing file 
can be mapped to a variable. 
We take as given the structure of the data
in the file, and then 
 the J program
must supply a description of the desired mapping.
For example, a file with fixed-length records
could be mapped to a character table. 
<p>
In the second case, a file can be
created in J in a special format (called "jmf")
specifically for the purpose
of mapping to a variable.  In this case,
the description is automatically derived
from the variable and stored in the file along with the
data. Thus a "jmf" file is self-describing.
<p>
We look first at creating jmf files, and then at mapping given files..
<H3>28.4.1   Library Script for Mapped Files</H3>
There is a library script, <TT>jmf.ijs</TT>, for handling mapped files.
For present purposes it is simplest to download it directly from the
J Application Library. Here is a 
<A HREF="http://www.jsoftware.com/svn/addons/trunk/data/jmf/jmf.ijs"> link to jmf.ijs </A>.
<p>
Assuming we have downloaded it into say, directory <TT>C:\temp</TT> for example, 
we can load it into our J session with:
<PRE>
   load 'c:\temp\jmf.ijs'
   
</PRE>
The script will load itself into the locale <TT>jmf</TT> .
<A NAME="14"></A>
<H3>28.4.2  jmf Files and Persistent Variables</H3>
Suppose we have constructed 
an array <TT>V</TT> with some
valuable data, 
which from now on we aim to use and maintain
over a number of J sessions. Perhaps <TT>V</TT> is valuable
now, or perhaps it will become valuable over subsequent
sessions as it is modified and added-to.
<p>
Our valuable data <TT>V</TT> can be an array of numbers,
of characters, or of boxes.  For a simple example we 
start with <TT>V</TT> as a table of numbers. 
<PRE>
   ] V =:  2 2 $ 1 2 3 4
1 2
3 4
</PRE>
We can make a persistent variable from <TT>V</TT> as follows.
<p>
Step 1 is to estimate the size, in bytes,
of a file required for the value of <TT>V</TT>.
Since we expect that over time
<TT>V</TT> may grow from its present size
ultimately to, say, 64 KB,
then our estimate <TT>S</TT> is 
<PRE>
   S =: 64000
</PRE>
If in doubt, allow plenty.
The size must be given as
a positive integer (not a float) and therefore
less than 2147483648 (2Gb) on a 32-bit machine.
<p>
Step 2 is to choose a file-name and, for convenience,
 define a variable <TT>F</TT> to hold the the file name as a string. 
For example: 
<PRE>
   F =: 'c:\temp\persis.jmf'
</PRE>
Step 3 is to create file <TT>F</TT> as a jmf file,
large enough to hold <TT>S</TT> bytes of data.  For this purpose 
the utility function <TT>createjmf</TT> is available (in locale <TT>jmf</TT>)
so we can write: 
<PRE>
   createjmf_jmf_ F;S
</PRE>
(On your system, with a different version of J, 
you may see a response different from what is shown here.)
<p>
At this point, file <TT>F</TT> exists.
If we inspect it we see its actual size is 
 a little larger than <TT>S</TT>, 
to accommodate a header record which makes the file
 self-describing.
<PRE>
   fdir F
+----------+----------------+-----+---+------+
|persis.jmf|2011 1 8 9 38 32|64284|rw-|-----a|
+----------+----------------+-----+---+------+
</PRE>
The content of file <TT>F</TT> is initially set by 
<TT>createjmf_jmf_</TT> to represent a J
value, in fact a zero-length list.
 The important point is
that file <TT>F</TT> now contains a definite value.
<p>
Step 4 is to map the content of file <TT>F</TT>
to a new variable, for which we choose the name <TT>P</TT>.
<PRE>
   map_jmf_ 'P'; F
</PRE>
This statement means, in effect:
<PRE>
               P =:  value-currently-in-file-F
</PRE>
and we can verify that <TT>P</TT> is now an empty list:
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>P</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>$ P</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>&nbsp;</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>0</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Notice particularly that
the effect of mapping file <TT>F</TT> to variable <TT>P</TT>
is to assign the value in <TT>F</TT> to <TT>P</TT> and not the
 other way around.
Hence we avoided mapping file <TT>F</TT> directly
onto our valuable array <TT>V</TT> because <TT>V</TT> would be
overwritten by the preset initial value in <TT>F</TT>, 
and lost.
<p>
Step 5  is to assign to <TT>P</TT> the desired value, that of
 <TT>V</TT>
<PRE>
   P =: V
</PRE>
Variable <TT>P</TT> is now a persistent variable, 
since it is mapped to file <TT>F</TT>.  
We can amend <TT>P</TT>, for example by changing the value
at row 0 column 1 to <TT>99</TT>.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>P</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>P =:  99 (<0 1) } P </TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>1 2<BR>
3 4</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1 99<BR>
3&nbsp;&nbsp;4</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
or by appending a new row:
<PRE>
   ] P =: P ,  0 0
1 99
3  4
0  0
</PRE>
Step 6 is needed before we finish the current session.
We <TT>unmap</TT> variable <TT>P</TT>, to ensure file <TT>F</TT> 
 is closed. 
<PRE>
   unmap_jmf_ 'P'
0
</PRE>
The result of <TT>0</TT> indicates success. The variable <TT>P</TT>
 no longer exists: 
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>P</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>$ P</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>error</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>$ P</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
To demonstrate that the value of <TT>P</TT> persists in file 
 <TT>F</TT> we repeat
the mapping, processing and unmapping in this or another session.
The name <TT>P</TT> we chose for our persistent variable is
only for this session. In another session,
the persistent variable in file <TT>F</TT> can 
be mapped to any name. 
<p>
This time we choose the name <TT>Q</TT> for the persistent 
 variable. We map file <TT>F</TT> to <TT>Q</TT>: 
<PRE>
   map_jmf_ 'Q' ; F
   
   Q
1 99
3  4
0  0
</PRE>
modify <TT>Q</TT>:
<PRE>
   ] Q =: Q , 7 8 
1 99
3  4
0  0
7  8
</PRE>
and unmap <TT>Q</TT> to close file <TT>F</TT>.
<PRE>
   unmap_jmf_ 'Q'
0
   
</PRE>
<H3>28.4.3  Mapped Files are of Fixed Size</H3>
Recall that we created file <TT>F</TT> large enough for <TT>S</TT>
bytes of data.  
<PRE>
   S
64000
   fdir F
+----------+----------------+-----+---+------+
|persis.jmf|2011 1 8 9 38 32|64284|rw-|-----a|
+----------+----------------+-----+---+------+
</PRE>
The variable in file <TT>F</TT>  is 
currently much smaller than this, and the unused trailing part of the file
is filled with junk.
However, if we continue to modify <TT>Q</TT> by appending to
 it,
we reach a limit, by filling the file, 
 and encounter an error. To demonstrate, with a verb
<TT>fill</TT> for the purpose:
<PRE>
   fill =: 3 : 0
try.   while. 1 do. Q =: Q , 99 99 end.
catch. 'full'
end.
)
   
   map_jmf_ 'Q'; F 
   fill ''
full
   
   
</PRE>
The amount of data now in <TT>Q</TT> can be estimated as 4 bytes per 
integer (since <TT>Q</TT>
is integer) 
multiplied by the number of integers, that is, altogether <TT>4 * */$ Q</TT>.
This result for the final size of <TT>Q</TT> accords with our
original size estimate <TT>S</TT>.

<H3>28.4.4  Given Files</H3>
Now we look at mapping ordinary data files (that is, files
other than the special jmf-format files we considered above).
<p>
The way the data is laid out in the file
we take as given, and our task is specify
how this layout is to be represented by the type, rank and shape
of a J variable, that is, to specify a suitable mapping. 
<p>
For example, suppose we aim to read a given file <TT>G</TT> with its data
laid out in fixed-length records, each record
being 8 characters.  Suppose file <TT>G</TT> was originally created
by, say: 
<PRE>
        G =: 'c:\temp\data.xyz'
</PRE>
<PRE>
   'ABCD0001EFGH0002IJKL0003MNOP0004' fwrite G
32
</PRE>
The next step is to decide what kind of
a variable will be suitable for mapping the data in
file <TT>G</TT>.  
We decide on an n-by-8 character table.
The number of rows, <TT>n</TT>,  will be determined by the
amount of data in the file, 
so we do not specify <TT>n</TT> in advance.
<p>
It is convenient to start 
with a small example of an n-by-8 character table,
which we call a prototype. The choice of <TT>n</TT> is unimportant.
<PRE>
   prototype =: 1 8 $ 'a'
</PRE>
Now the mapping can be defined by: 
<PRE>
   ] mapping =: ((3!:0) ; (}. @: $)) prototype
+-+-+
|2|8|
+-+-+
</PRE>
We see that <TT>mapping</TT> is a boxed list. The first item 
is the data-type. Here <TT>2</TT>, meaning "character",  is produced
by <TT>3!:0 prototype</TT>.  The second item is the trailing dimensions
(that is, all but the first) of the prototype. 
Here <TT>8</TT> is all but the first of <TT>1 8</TT>, 
 produced by
<TT>(}.@:$) prototype</TT>.  Thus <TT>mapping</TT> expresses or
encodes "n-by-8 characters".
<p>
Now <TT>mapping</TT> is supplied as left argument to
(dyadic) <TT>map_jmf_</TT>. We map file <TT>G</TT> onto a variable for which
we choose the name <TT>W</TT> thus:
<PRE>
   mapping map_jmf_ 'W'; G
</PRE>
We see that <TT>W</TT> is now a variable. Its value is the data in the file.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>W</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>$ W</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>

EFGH0002<BR>
IJKL0003<BR>

<TD><TT>4 8</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
We can amend the data in the ususal way:
<PRE>
   ] W =: 'IJKL9999' 2 } W
ABCD0001
EFGH0002
IJKL9999
MNOP0004
</PRE>
What we cannot do is add another row to the data, 
because all the space in file <TT>G</TT> is occupied 
by the data we already have.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>

<H3>28.4.5  Mapped Variables Are Special</H3>
Mapping files to variables offers the programmer
significant advantages in functionality and convenience.
<p>
The price to be paid for these advantages is
that there are some considerations applying to mapped variables
 which do not apply to ordinary variables. The programmer
needs to be aware of, and to manage, these considerations.
This is our topic in this section and the next.
<p>
If <TT>A</TT> is an ordinary variable, not mapped,
then in the assignment <TT>B=: A</TT> the value of <TT>A</TT> is in effect
copied to <TT>B</TT>. A subsequent change to <TT>A</TT> does not affect
the value of <TT>B</TT>.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>A =: 1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>B =: A</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>B</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>A =: 2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>B</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
By contrast, consider a variable mapped to a file.
If the file is very large, 
there may not be
enough space for another copy of the value.
Hence copying is to be avoided. 
<p>
Compare the previous example with the case when
<TT>A</TT> is a mapped variable. 
<PRE>
   map_jmf_ 'A';F
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>A =: 1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>B =: A</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>B</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>A =: 2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>B</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>2</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
We see that <TT>B</TT> changes with changes to <TT>A</TT>.
In effect <TT>B =: A</TT> means that <TT>B</TT> is
another name for <TT>A</TT>, not a copy of the value of <TT>A</TT>. That is,
both <TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT> refer to the same thing - the value
in the file.
<p>
Hence it is also the case that 
<TT>A</TT> changes with changes to <TT>B</TT>. 
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>A</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>B =: 7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>A</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>7</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>7</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Consider now an explicit verb applied 
to a mapped variable. 
Here <TT>y</TT> becomes another name for the data 
in the file.
Hence assignment to <TT>y</TT> (even a local assignment)
may cause an unintended change the mapped variable in the file.
For example
<PRE>
   foo =: 3 : ' 3 * y =. y + 1'
   
   
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>foo 2</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>A</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>foo A</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>A</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>

<H3>28.4.6  Unmapping Revisited</H3>
The current status of mapped files and variables
is maintained by the J system in a 
"mapping table".   The mapping table
can be displayed by entering the expression
<TT>showmap_jmf_ ''</TT> but for 
present purposes here is a utility function
to display only selected columns.
<PRE>
   status =: 0 1 9 & {"1  @: showmap_jmf_
   status ''
+-------+------------------+----+
|name   |fn                |refs|
+-------+------------------+----+
|A_base_|c:\temp\persis.jmf|3   |
+-------+------------------+----+
   
</PRE>
We see that currently variable 
<TT>A</TT> in locale <TT>base</TT> is mapped to file <TT>F</TT> (persis.jmf). 
<p>
Under "refs", 
the value <TT>3</TT> means that the data
in file <TT>F</TT> is the target of 3 references.
One of these is variable <TT>A</TT>, 
a second is the variable <TT>B</TT> (which we know to
be another name for <TT>A</TT>) and the third 
is for the system itself.
<p>
Variables <TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT> are both in existence:
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>A</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>B</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>8</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>8</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
For the sake of simplicity, a recommended procedure for closing the file 
is first to 
erase all variables such as <TT>B</TT> which are alternative names for the 
originally-mapped
variable <TT>A</TT>
<PRE>
   erase <'B' 
1
</PRE>
The status shows the number of references is reduced.
<PRE>
   status ''
+-------+------------------+----+
|name   |fn                |refs|
+-------+------------------+----+
|A_base_|c:\temp\persis.jmf|2   |
+-------+------------------+----+
</PRE>
Now we can unmap <TT>A</TT>.  
<PRE>
   unmap_jmf_ 'A'
0
</PRE>
The result of <TT>0</TT> means the file is closed 
and <TT>A</TT> erased. The status table shows no entries, 
that is, that no files are mapped.
<PRE>
   status ''
+----+--+----+
|name|fn|refs|
+----+--+----+
   
</PRE>
Let us recreate the situation 
in which <TT>A</TT> is mapped to <TT>F</TT>
and <TT>B</TT> is another name for <TT>A</TT>, 
so there
are 3 references to (the data in) 
file <TT>F</TT>.
<PRE>
   map_jmf_ 'A'; F
   B =: A
   status ''
+-------+------------------+----+
|name   |fn                |refs|
+-------+------------------+----+
|A_base_|c:\temp\persis.jmf|3   |
+-------+------------------+----+
</PRE>
What happens if we erase all the 
variables referring to <TT>F</TT> ?
<PRE>
   erase 'A';'B'
1 1
   status ''
+-------+------------------+----+
|name   |fn                |refs|
+-------+------------------+----+
|A_base_|c:\temp\persis.jmf|1   |
+-------+------------------+----+
</PRE>
We see there is still a single reference,
under the name <TT>A</TT> even though there
is no variable <TT>A</TT>.  This single
reference reflects the fact that file <TT>F</TT>
is not yet unmapped. 
<p>
Thus when we said
earlier that file <TT>F</TT> gets mapped to
variable <TT>A</TT>, it would be more accurate
to say that file <TT>F</TT> gets mapped to the 
name <TT>A</TT>, and a variable of that name is
created.  
Even though the variable is subsequently erased,
the name <TT>A</TT> still identifies the mapped file,
and can be used as an argument to <TT>unmap</TT>.
<PRE>
   unmap_jmf_ 'A'
0
   status ''
+----+--+----+
|name|fn|refs|
+----+--+----+
</PRE>
