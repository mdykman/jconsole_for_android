DGBEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an
M-by-N band matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the
row scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to
make the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have absolute value 1.


R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be between SMLNUM = smallest safe
number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use of these scaling factors
is not guaranteed to reduce the condition number of A but works well
in practice.


Arguments
=========

M       (input) INTEGER
        The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

KL      (input) INTEGER
        The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.

KU      (input) INTEGER
        The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.

AB      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
        The band matrix A, stored in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.  The j-th
        column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as
        follows:
        AB(ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl).

LDAB    (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KL+KU+1.

R       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (M)
        If INFO = 0, or INFO > M, R contains the row scale factors
        for A.

C       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        If INFO = 0, C contains the column scale factors for A.

ROWCND  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, ROWCND contains the ratio of the
        smallest R(i) to the largest R(i).  If ROWCND >= 0.1 and
        AMAX is neither too large nor too small, it is not worth
        scaling by R.

COLCND  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        If INFO = 0, COLCND contains the ratio of the smallest
        C(i) to the largest C(i).  If COLCND >= 0.1, it is not
        worth scaling by C.

AMAX    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
        close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
        should be scaled.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is

        <= M:  the i-th row of A is exactly zero

        >  M:  the (i-M)-th column of A is exactly zero
