DPOTRI computes the inverse of a real symmetric positive definite
matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
computed by DPOTRF.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
        On entry, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
        factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by
        DPOTRF.
        On exit, the upper or lower triangle of the (symmetric)
        inverse of A, overwriting the input factor U or L.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  if INFO = i, the (i,i) element of the factor U or L is
        zero, and the inverse could not be computed.
