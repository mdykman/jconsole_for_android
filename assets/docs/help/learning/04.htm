<H1>Chapter 4: Scripts and Explicit Functions</H1>
What is called a "script" is a sequence of lines of J 
where the whole sequence can be replayed on demand to perform
a computation.   
The themes of this chapter are scripts, functions defined by scripts, 
and scripts in files.
<A NAME="02"></A>
<H2>4.1  Text</H2>
Here is an assignment to the variable <TT>txt</TT>:
<PRE>
   txt =: 0 : 0
What is called a "script" is
a sequence of lines of J.
)
</PRE>
The expression <TT>0 : 0</TT> means "as follows", that is, <TT>0 : 0</TT> is a verb
which takes as its argument, and delivers as its result, whatever lines
are typed following it, down to the line beginning with the solo right-
parenthesis.
<p>
The value of <TT>txt</TT> is these two lines, in a single character string.
The string contains line-feed (<TT>LF</TT>) characters, 
which cause <TT>txt</TT> to be displayed as several lines.
<TT>txt</TT> has a certain length, it is rank 1, that is, just a list, and it
 contains 2 line-feed characters.
<PRE>
   txt
What is called a "script" is
a sequence of lines of J.

</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>$ txt</TT></TD>
<TD><TT># $ txt</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>+/ txt = LF</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>55</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>2</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Let us say that <TT>txt</TT> is a "text" variable, that is,
a character string with zero or more line-feed characters.
<A NAME="03"></A>
<H2>4.2  Scripts for Procedures</H2>
Here we look at computations described as step-by-step procedures to be 
followed.
For a very simple example, the Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion can be 
described in two steps.
Given some temperature <TT>T</TT> say in degrees Fahrenheit:
<PRE>
   T =: 212
</PRE>
then the first step is subtracting 32. Call the result <TT>t</TT>, say
<PRE>
   t =: T - 32
</PRE>
The second step is multiplying <TT>t</TT> by <TT>5%9</TT> to give the temperature in 
degrees Celsius.
<PRE>
   t * 5 % 9
100
</PRE>
Suppose we intend to perform this computation several times with different
 values of <TT>T</TT>. 
We could record this two-line procedure 
as a script which can be replayed on demand.  The script
consists of the lines of J stored in a text variable, thus:
<PRE>
   script =: 0 : 0
t =: T - 32
t * 5 % 9
)
</PRE>
Scripts like this can be executed with the built-in J verb given 
by the expression <TT>0 !: 111</TT> which we can call, say, <TT>do</TT>.
<PRE>
   do =: 0 !: 111
   
</PRE>
<PRE>
       do  script
</PRE>
We should now see the lines on the screen just as though they had been 
typed in from the keyboard:
<PRE>
   t =: T - 32
   t * 5 % 9
100
   
</PRE>
We can run the script again with a different value for <TT>T</TT>
<PRE>
   T =: 32
   do script
   t =: T - 32
   t * 5 % 9
0
</PRE>
<A NAME="04"></A>
<H2>4.3  Explicitly-Defined Functions</H2>
Functions can be defined by scripts.
Here is an example, the Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion as a verb.
<PRE>
   Celsius =: 3 : 0
t =: y - 32
t * 5 % 9
)
   
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>Celsius 32 212</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1 + Celsius 32 212</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>0 100</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1 101</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Let us look at this definition more closely
<H3>4.3.1  Heading</H3>
The function is introduced with the expression <TT>3 : 0</TT> which means: "a 
verb as follows".
(By contrast, recall that <TT>0 : 0</TT> means "a character string as follows").
<p>
The colon in <TT>3 : 0</TT> is a conjunction. Its left argument <TT>(3)</TT> means 
"verb". Its right argument <TT>(0)</TT>
means "lines following". 
For more details, see <A HREF="12.htm">Chapter 12</A>.  A function introduced in this way
is called "explicitly-defined", or just "explicit".
<H3>4.3.2  Meaning</H3>
The expression <TT>(Celsius 32 212)</TT> applies the verb <TT>Celsius</TT>
to the argument <TT>32 212</TT>, 
by carrying out a computation which can be described, or modelled, like 
this:
<PRE>
   y =: 32 212
   t =: y - 32
   t * 5 % 9
0 100
</PRE>
Notice that, after the first line, 
the computation proceeds according to the script.
<H3>4.3.3  Argument Variable(s)</H3>
The value of the argument <TT>(32 212)</TT> is supplied to the script as a 
variable named <TT>y</TT> . 
This "argument variable" is named <TT>y</TT> in a monadic function. (In a
 dyadic function, as we shall see below,
the left argument is named <TT>x</TT> and the right is <TT>y</TT>)
<A NAME="05"></A>
<H3>4.3.4  Local Variables</H3>
Here is our definition of <TT>Celsius</TT> repeated:
<PRE>
   Celsius =: 3 : 0
t =: y - 32
t * 5 % 9
)
</PRE>
We see it contains an assignment to a variable <TT>t</TT>.
This variable is used only during the execution of <TT>Celsius</TT>. 
Unfortunately this assignment to <TT>t</TT> interferes with the value of any other
variable also called <TT>t</TT>, defined outside <TT>Celsius</TT>, which we happen to be
 using at the time. 
To demonstrate:
<PRE>
   t =: 'hello' 
   
   Celsius 212
100
   
   t
180
</PRE>
We see that the variable <TT>t</TT> with original value (<TT>'hello'</TT>) has been
 changed in executing <TT>Celsius</TT>.
To avoid this undesirable effect, we declare that <TT>t</TT> inside <TT>Celsius</TT> is
 to be a strictly private affair, 
distinct from any other variable called <TT>t</TT>.
<p>
For this purpose there is a special form of assignment,  with the symbol
 <TT>=.</TT> (equal dot).
Our revised definition becomes: 
<PRE>
   Celsius =: 3 : 0
t =. y - 32
t * 5 % 9
)
</PRE>
and we say that <TT>t</TT> in <TT>Celsius</TT> is a local variable, or that <TT>t</TT> is local
 to <TT>Celsius</TT>. 
By contrast, a variable defined outside
a function is said to be global.
Now we can demonstrate that in <TT>Celsius</TT> assignment to local variable <TT>t</TT>
 does not affect 
any global variable <TT>t</TT>
<PRE>
   t =: 'hello'
    
   Celsius 212
100
   
   t
hello
</PRE>
The argument-variable <TT>y</TT> is also a local variable. Hence the evaluation
 of 
<TT>(Celsius 32 212)</TT> is more accurately modelled by the computation:
<PRE>
   y =. 32 212
   t  =. y - 32
   t * 5 % 9
0 100
</PRE>
<H3>4.3.5  Dyadic Verbs</H3>
<TT>Celsius</TT> is a monadic verb, introduced with <TT>3 : 0</TT> and defined in terms 
of the single argument <TT>y</TT>.  By contrast, a dyadic verb 
is introduced with <TT>4 : 0</TT>. The left and right arguments 
are always named <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> respectively
Here is an example. The "positive difference" of two numbers is the larger
 minus the smaller.
<PRE>
   posdiff =: 4 : 0
larger  =. x >. y
smaller =. x <. y
larger - smaller 
)
</PRE>
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>3 posdiff 4</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>4 posdiff 3</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>1</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
<H3>4.3.6  One-Liners</H3>
A one-line script can be written as a character string, and given as the 
right argument
of the colon conjunction. 
<PRE>
   PosDiff =: 4 : '(x >. y) - (x <. y)'
   4 PosDiff 3
1
</PRE>
<A NAME="06"></A>
<H3>4.3.7  Control Structures</H3>
In the examples we have seen so far of functions defined by scripts, 
execution begins with the expression on the first line, 
proceeds to the next line,  and so on to  the last. 
<p>
This straight-through path is not the only path possible.
A choice can be made as to which expression to execute next.
<p>
For an example, here is a function to compute a volume from given length,
 width and height. Suppose the function is to check that 
its argument is given correctly as a list of 3 items (length, width and height). 
If so, a volume is computed. If not,  the result is to be the character-string 
<TT>'ERROR'</TT>.
<PRE>
   volume =: 3 : 0
if.   3 = # y
do.   * / y
else. 'ERROR'
end.
)
</PRE>
We see:
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>volume 2 3 4</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>volume 2 3</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>24</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>ERROR</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
Everything from <TT>if.</TT> to <TT>end.</TT> together forms what is called a "control structure".
Within it <TT>if.</TT> <TT>do.</TT> <TT>else.</TT> and <TT>end.</TT> are called "control words".
See <A HREF="12.htm">Chapter 12</A> for more on control structures.
<H2>4.4  Tacit and Explicit Compared</H2>
We have now seen two different styles of function definition.  
The explicit style, introduced in this chapter, is so called because it
explicitly mentions variables standing for arguments. Thus in <TT>volume</TT>
 above,
the variable <TT>y</TT> is an explicit mention of an argument.
<p>
By contrast, the style we looked at in the previous chapter is called 
 "tacit", because there is no
mention of variables standing for arguments. 
For example, compare explicit and tacit
definitions of the positive-difference function:
<PRE>
   epd =: 4 : '(x >. y) - (x <. y)'
   
   tpd =: >. - <.
</PRE>
Many functions defined in the tacit style
can also be defined explicitly, and vice versa.  
Which style is preferable depends on what seems most natural,  in
the light of however we conceive the function to be defined. 
The choice lies between
breaking down the problem into, on the one hand, a scripted sequence of 
 steps or,  on the other hand, 
a collection of smaller functions.
<p>
The tacit style allows a compact definition.  For this reason, tacit 
functions lend themselves well to systematic analysis and transformation.
Indeed, the J system can, for a broad class of tacit functions, 
automatically compute such transformations as inverses
and derivatives. 
<A NAME="07"></A>
<H2>4.5  Functions as Values</H2>
A function is a value, and a value can be displayed by entering an 
expression.  An expression can be 
as simple as a name.  Here are some values of tacit and explicit functions:
<PRE>
   - & 32
+-+-+--+
|-|&|32|
+-+-+--+
   
   epd
+-+-+-------------------+
|4|:|(x >. y) - (x <. y)|
+-+-+-------------------+
   
   Celsius
+-+-+-----------+
|3|:|t =. y - 32|
| | |t * 5 % 9  |
+-+-+-----------+
</PRE>
<A NAME="08"></A>
The value of each function is here represented as a 
boxed structure. This is the default, but we can choose 
from several other possibilities:  see <A HREF="27.htm">Chapter 27</A>.  For now I 
will mention only the
"linear representation", 
which shows a function as a sequence of characters which could be 
typed in again to produce the function.  We can switch the session to 
to show functions in the linear representation by entering:
<PRE>
   (9!:3) 5

</PRE>
and we see for example:
<PRE>
   epd
4 : '(x >. y) - (x <. y)'
</PRE>
In the following chapters, values of functions will often be shown 
in this linear representation.
<A NAME="09"></A>
<H2>4.6  Script Files</H2>
We have seen scripts (lines of J) used for definitions of single variables:
 text variables
or functions. 
 By contrast, a file holding lines of J as text can store many definitions.
Such a file is called a script file, and its usefulness is that 
all its definitions together can be executed by reading the file.
<p>
Here is an example. 
Using a text-editor of your choice, create a file on your computer, 
containing 2 lines of text like the following.
<PRE>
                 squareroot =: %:
</PRE>
<PRE>
                 z =: 1 , (2+2) , (4+5)
</PRE>
A J script file has a filename ending with <TT>.ijs</TT> by convention, 
so suppose the file is created (in Windows) with the full pathname 
 <TT>c:\temp\myscript.ijs</TT> for example.
<p>
Then in the J session it will be convenient
to identify the file by defining a variable <TT>F</TT> say 
to hold this filename as a string.
<PRE>
   F =: 'c:\temp\myscript.ijs'   
   
</PRE>
Having created this 2-line script file, 
we can execute it by typing at the keyboard:
<PRE>
       0!:1 < F
</PRE>
and we should now see the lines on the screen just as though they had been
 typed from the keyboard.
<PRE>
   squareroot =: %:
   z =: 1 ,(2+2), (4+5)
</PRE>
We can now compute with the definitions we have just loaded in from the 
file:
<PRE>
   z
1 4 9
   
   squareroot z
1 2 3
</PRE>
The activities in a J session will be typically a mixture of editing script
 files,
loading or reloading the definitions from script files, and initiating
 computations
at the keyboard.  
What carries over from one session to another is only the script files.
The state, or memory,  of the J system itself 
disappears at the end of the session, along with all the definitions 
entered during the session.
Hence it is a good idea to ensure, before ending a J session, that any 
script file is up to date, that is,
it contains all the definitions you wish to preserve.
<p>
At the beginning of a session the J system will automatically load a 
designated script file,
called the "profile". (See <A HREF="26.htm">Chapter 26</A> for more details). 
The profile can be edited, and is a good place to record any definitions 
of your own 
which you find generally useful.
We have now come to the end of Chapter 4 and of Part 1.
The following chapters will treat, in more
depth and detail, the themes we have
touched upon in Part 1.
