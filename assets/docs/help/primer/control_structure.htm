<h1>Control structure</h1>
In centigrade the sentences in the definition are just executed sequentially, one after the other. To conditionally control which sentences are executed you use control structures.<br>
<br>
Control structures are built with control words and sentences. The following is an example of a control structure:<br>

<pre>if. x = 'c'
 do. centigrade y
 else. fahrenheit y
end. 
</pre>
The<font face=courier size=-1> if.</font> control word starts the control structure and the end. control word ends it. The result of the <font face=courier size=-1>x = 'c'</font> sentence is the test result and it determines which of the other sentences in the control structure are executed. If the test result is 1, then the sentence after the <font face=courier size=-1>do.</font> control word is executed. If the test result is any other value then the sentence after the <font face=courier size=-1>else.</font> control word is executed. In English: if the left argument equals the letter c, then execute <font face=courier size=-1>centigrade</font>, otherwise execute <font face=courier size=-1>fahrenheit</font>.<br>
<br>
Use this capability to add a new verb to your cf.ijs script that will convert a number from Fahrenheit to centigrade or from centigrade to Fahrenheit depending on the value of the left argument. Open your cf.ijs script and add the following definition at the end.<br>

<pre>NB. convert f to c if x is 'c', otherwise c to f
convert =: dyad : 0
if. x = 'c'
 do. centigrade y
 else. fahrenheit y
end.
)</pre>
This defines the dyadic case of the verb. The dyad has a left argument with the name <font face=courier size=-1>x</font> and a right argument with the name <font face=courier size=-1>y</font> . The verb <font face=courier size=-1>convert </font>takes a left argument of <font face=courier size=-1>'c'</font> to convert a Fahrenheit value to centigrade. Any left argument other than <font face=courier size=-1>'c'</font> will convert a centigrade value to Fahrenheit.<br>
<br>
Note that you use your verbs <font face=courier size=-1>fahrenheit </font>and <font face=courier size=-1>centigrade </font>just as you would use primitive verbs.<br>
<br>
Run the script and test convert.<br>

<pre>   'c' convert  212
100
   'f' convert 100
212</pre>
Normally a sentence is a line in a script. However, with control words separating a line into several sentences it is possible to have more than one sentence on a line.<br>
<br>
The following line is equivalent to the multiple lines used earlier.<br>

<pre>if. x = 'c' do. centigrade y else. fahrenheit y end.
</pre>
Control structures are only allowed in definitions and you cannot type one directly into the ijx window for execution.<br>
<br>
There are nine control structure patterns:<br>

<pre>if. T do. B end.
if. T do. B else. B1 end.
if. T do. B elseif. T1 do. B1 elseif. T2 do. B2 end.
try. B catch. B1 end.
while. T do. B end.
whilst. T do. B end.
for. T do. B end.
for_i. T do. B end.
select. T
 case. T0 do. B0
 case. T1 do. B1
 fcase.T2 do. B2
 case. T3 do. B3
end.</pre>
A control structure starts with <font face=courier size=-1>if.</font> , <font face=courier size=-1>try.</font> , <font face=courier size=-1>while.</font> , <font face=courier size=-1>whilst </font>, <font face=courier size=-1>for.</font> , <font face=courier size=-1>for_i.</font> , or <font face=courier size=-1>select.</font> and ends with a matching end<font face=courier size=-1>.</font> .<br>
<br>
Words beginning with T or B denote a block of 0 or more sentences and can contain nested control structures.<br>
<br>
The result of the last sentence in a T block determines which block is executed next and whether execution in the control structure is finished.<br>
<br>
Often the T block is a single sentence that makes a simple test like the one in the example.<br>
<br>
The <font face=courier size=-1>try</font>. control structure is an interesting one. It executes the B block of sentences, and if there are no errors it skips to the end of the structure. However, if there is an error, then the B1 block is executed.<br>
<br>
The <font face=courier size=-1>while.</font> control structure executes the T block and if its result is not 0 then it executes the B block and continues this until the T block has a 0 result. If the T block is 0 the first time, then the B block is not executed.<br>
<br>
The <font face=courier size=-1>whilst.</font> control structure is the same as while. except that the T block is skipped the first time. This means that the B block is always executed at least once.<br>
<br>
In the for. structure, the B block is evaluated once for each item of the array A that results from evaluating the T block. In the for_i. form, the local name i is set to the value of an item on each evaluation of the B block and i_index is set to the index of the item. A break. goes to the end of the for. control structure, and continue. goes to the evaluation of B for the next item. <br>
<br>
In the select. structure, the result R of T is compared to the elements of the result Ri of Ti , and the Bi block of the first case. or fcase. with a match is evaluated. Evaluation of the select. control structure then terminates for a case. , or continues with the next B(i+1) block for an fcase. (and further continues if it is an fcase.). <br>
<br>
See the J Dictionary for more information on control structures.<br>
