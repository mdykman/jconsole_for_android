DLASET initializes an m-by-n matrix A to BETA on the diagonal and
ALPHA on the offdiagonals.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        Specifies the part of the matrix A to be set.
        = 'U':      Upper triangular part is set; the strictly lower
        triangular part of A is not changed.
        = 'L':      Lower triangular part is set; the strictly upper
        triangular part of A is not changed.
        Otherwise:  All of the matrix A is set.

M       (input) INTEGER
        The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

ALPHA   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
        The constant to which the offdiagonal elements are to be set.

BETA    (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
        The constant to which the diagonal elements are to be set.

A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
        On exit, the leading m-by-n submatrix of A is set as follows:

        if UPLO = 'U', A(i,j) = ALPHA, 1<=i<=j-1, 1<=j<=n,
        if UPLO = 'L', A(i,j) = ALPHA, j+1<=i<=m, 1<=j<=n,
        otherwise,     A(i,j) = ALPHA, 1<=i<=m, 1<=j<=n, i.ne.j,

        and, for all UPLO, A(i,i) = BETA, 1<=i<=min(m,n).

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
