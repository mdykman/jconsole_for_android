DPBEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
symmetric positive definite band matrix A and reduce its condition
number (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors,
S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This
choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
scalings.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U':  Upper triangular of A is stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangular of A is stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

KD      (input) INTEGER
        The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
        or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.

AB      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
        The upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band matrix A,
        stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column
        of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
        if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
        if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
        LDAB     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDAB >= KD+1.

S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.

SCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
        the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
        large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.

AMAX    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
        close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
        should be scaled.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

        > 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.
