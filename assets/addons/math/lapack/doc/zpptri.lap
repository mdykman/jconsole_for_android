ZPPTRI computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian positive definite
matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H
computed by ZPPTRF.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U':  Upper triangular factor is stored in AP;

        = 'L':  Lower triangular factor is stored in AP.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

AP      (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
        On entry, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
        factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, packed columnwise as
        a linear array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the
        array AP as follows:
        if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
        if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

        On exit, the upper or lower triangle of the (Hermitian)
        inverse of A, overwriting the input factor U or L.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  if INFO = i, the (i,i) element of the factor U or L is
        zero, and the inverse could not be computed.
