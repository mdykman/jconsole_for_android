DTRSNA estimates reciprocal condition numbers for specified
eigenvalues and/or right eigenvectors of a real upper quasi-triangular
matrix T (or of any matrix Q*T*Q**T with Q orthogonal).

T must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that is,
block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each
2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.


Arguments
=========

JOB     (input) CHARACTER*1
        Specifies whether condition numbers are required for
        eigenvalues (S) or eigenvectors (SEP):

        = 'E': for eigenvalues only (S);

        = 'V': for eigenvectors only (SEP);

        = 'B': for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors (S and SEP).

HOWMNY  (input) CHARACTER*1

        = 'A': compute condition numbers for all eigenpairs;

        = 'S': compute condition numbers for selected eigenpairs
        specified by the array SELECT.

SELECT  (input) LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
        If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenpairs for which
        condition numbers are required. To select condition numbers
        for the eigenpair corresponding to a real eigenvalue w(j),
        SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE.. To select condition numbers
        corresponding to a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues w(j)
        and w(j+1), either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both, must be
        set to .TRUE..
        If HOWMNY = 'A', SELECT is not referenced.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.

T       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDT,N)
        The upper quasi-triangular matrix T, in Schur canonical form.

LDT     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).

VL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVL,M)
        If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VL must contain left eigenvectors of T
        (or of any Q*T*Q**T with Q orthogonal), corresponding to the
        eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY and SELECT. The eigenvectors
        must be stored in consecutive columns of VL, as returned by
        DHSEIN or DTREVC.
        If JOB = 'V', VL is not referenced.

LDVL    (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array VL.
        LDVL >= 1; and if JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVL >= N.

VR      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVR,M)
        If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VR must contain right eigenvectors of T
        (or of any Q*T*Q**T with Q orthogonal), corresponding to the
        eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY and SELECT. The eigenvectors
        must be stored in consecutive columns of VR, as returned by
        DHSEIN or DTREVC.
        If JOB = 'V', VR is not referenced.

LDVR    (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array VR.
        LDVR >= 1; and if JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVR >= N.

S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MM)
        If JOB = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of the
        selected eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the
        array. For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues two
        consecutive elements of S are set to the same value. Thus
        S(j), SEP(j), and the j-th columns of VL and VR all
        correspond to the same eigenpair (but not in general the
        j-th eigenpair, unless all eigenpairs are selected).
        If JOB = 'V', S is not referenced.

SEP     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MM)
        If JOB = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
        numbers of the selected eigenvectors, stored in consecutive
        elements of the array. For a complex eigenvector two
        consecutive elements of SEP are set to the same value. If
        the eigenvalues cannot be reordered to compute SEP(j), SEP(j)
        is set to 0; this can only occur when the true value would be
        very small anyway.
        If JOB = 'E', SEP is not referenced.

MM      (input) INTEGER
        The number of elements in the arrays S (if JOB = 'E' or 'B')
        and/or SEP (if JOB = 'V' or 'B'). MM >= M.

M       (output) INTEGER
        The number of elements of the arrays S and/or SEP actually
        used to store the estimated condition numbers.
        If HOWMNY = 'A', M is set to N.

WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK,N+1)
        If JOB = 'E', WORK is not referenced.

LDWORK  (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array WORK.
        LDWORK >= 1; and if JOB = 'V' or 'B', LDWORK >= N.

IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
        If JOB = 'E', IWORK is not referenced.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0: successful exit

        < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value


Further Details
===============

The reciprocal of the condition number of an eigenvalue lambda is
defined as


        S(lambda) = |v'*u| / (norm(u)*norm(v))


where u and v are the right and left eigenvectors of T corresponding
to lambda; v' denotes the conjugate-transpose of v, and norm(u)
denotes the Euclidean norm. These reciprocal condition numbers always
lie between zero (very badly conditioned) and one (very well
conditioned). If n = 1, S(lambda) is defined to be 1.


An approximate error bound for a computed eigenvalue W(i) is given by

                    EPS * norm(T) / S(i)


where EPS is the machine precision.


The reciprocal of the condition number of the right eigenvector u
corresponding to lambda is defined as follows. Suppose


            T = ( lambda  c  )

                (   0    T22 )


Then the reciprocal condition number is


        SEP( lambda, T22 ) = sigma-min( T22 - lambda*I )


where sigma-min denotes the smallest singular value. We approximate
the smallest singular value by the reciprocal of an estimate of the
one-norm of the inverse of T22 - lambda*I. If n = 1, SEP(1) is defined
to be abs(T(1,1)).


An approximate error bound for a computed right eigenvector VR(i) is
given by


                    EPS * norm(T) / SEP(i)
