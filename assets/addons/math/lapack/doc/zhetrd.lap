ZHETRD reduces a complex Hermitian matrix A to real symmetric
tridiagonal form T by a unitary similarity transformation: Q**H * A *
Q = T.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
        On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
        N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
        triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
        triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
        leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
        triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
        triangular part of A is not referenced.
        On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
        of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
        tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
        superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the unitary
        matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
        = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
        written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
        matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
        the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a product
        of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
        D(i) = A(i,i).

E       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
        The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
        E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.

TAU     (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
        The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
        Details).

WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LWORK)
        On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK   (input) INTEGER
        The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= 1.
        For optimum performance LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the
        optimal blocksize.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value


Further Details
===============

If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
reflectors


   Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).


Each H(i) has the form


   H(i) = I - tau * v * v'


where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with v(i+1:n)
= 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in

A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).


If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
reflectors


   Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).


Each H(i) has the form


   H(i) = I - tau * v * v'


where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with v(1:i) =
0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in A(i+2:n,i), and tau in
TAU(i).


The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
with n = 5:


if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':


  (  d   e   v2  v3  v4 )              (  d                  )
  (      d   e   v3  v4 )              (  e   d              )
  (          d   e   v4 )              (  v1  e   d          )
  (              d   e  )              (  v1  v2  e   d      )
  (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  v3  e   d  )

where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of T, and vi
denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).
