Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to
the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest
public address system ever built. But there was no concert,
no music, no fanfare, just a simple message.

<b>centered:</b>
<para align=center>'People of Earth, your attention please,' a voice said, and
it was wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound
with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man
weep.</para>

<b>right:</b>
<para align=right>'This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace
Planning Council,' the voice continued. 'As you will no
doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying
regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial
express route through your star system, and regrettably
your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition.
The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth
minutes. Thank you.'</para>

<para style=mypara>'...There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All
the planning charts and demolition orders have been on
display in your local planning department in Alpha Centauri
for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of
time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too
late to start making a fuss about it now.'</para>
