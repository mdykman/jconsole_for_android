DOPGTR generates a real orthogonal matrix Q which is defined as the
product of n-1 elementary reflectors H(i) of order n, as returned by
DSPTRD using packed storage:

if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),


if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U': Upper triangular packed storage used in previous
        call to DSPTRD;
        = 'L': Lower triangular packed storage used in previous
        call to DSPTRD.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix Q. N >= 0.

AP      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
        The vectors which define the elementary reflectors, as
        returned by DSPTRD.

TAU     (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
        TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
        reflector H(i), as returned by DSPTRD.

Q       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ,N)
        The N-by-N orthogonal matrix Q.

LDQ     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array Q. LDQ >= max(1,N).

WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)


INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
