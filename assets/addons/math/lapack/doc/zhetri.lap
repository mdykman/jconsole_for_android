ZHETRI computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix A
using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H computed by
ZHETRF.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
        as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
        = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;

        = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
        On entry, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
        used to obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZHETRF.

        On exit, if INFO = 0, the (Hermitian) inverse of the original
        matrix.  If UPLO = 'U', the upper triangular part of the
        inverse is formed and the part of A below the diagonal is not
        referenced; if UPLO = 'L' the lower triangular part of the
        inverse is formed and the part of A above the diagonal is
        not referenced.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
        Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
        as determined by ZHETRF.

WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)


INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0: successful exit

        < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) = 0; the matrix is singular and its
        inverse could not be computed.
