general/jod 0.9.70 
JOD J Object Dictionary
JOD (J Object Dictionary) is a J programming tool. It offers
a word oriented database for all types of J words. JOD 
supports linked dictionary databases and provides tools for 
documenting and testing J code. 

In J 7.0x JOD requires the following addons:

  data/jfiles
  arc/zip 

For more information see the JOD wiki pages (Info Button),
run the lab "JOD lab JOD Introduction" - JOD labs are under 
the General lab category - or visit The JOD Page at:

general/jodsource 0.9.70 
JOD Object Dictionary Source
(jodsource.zip) is an archive containing serialized dump
versions of the three JOD dictionary databases (joddev,jod,utils)
that are used to build the JOD system.  JOD system dictionaries are
good examples of how JOD can be used to build complex J systems.

In J 7.0x JOD requires the following addons:

  data/jfiles
  arc/zip 

JOD source dictionaries in (jodsource.zip) can be set up in two ways:

1) Run the J script ~addons/general/jodsource/jodsourcesetup.ijs

   This is the recommended method.  (jodsourcesetup.ijs) has been
   checked on Windows j6.02, j7.01 and linux j7.01  32 bit systems.
   NOTE: It can take a minute or so to run.

2) Run the JOD lab "JOD Source Code Dump Scripts." 
   JOD labs are in the general lab category.

   JOD labs have not been made completely portable between
   Windows and Linux.  This lab works on Windows and it
   will work on Linux as well: provided you do not have
   any extant JOD dictionaries.

general/jtags 1.0.8 
jtags - Generate tag files for J source code
The ctags and etags programs (hereinafter collectively referred to
as ctags, except where distinguished) generate an index (or "tag")
file for a variety of language objects found in file(s).  This tag
file allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text
editor or other utility.  A "tag" signifies a language object for
which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index
entry created for that object).

jtags is a stand-alone Linux shell script to generate tag files
without ctags programs.

options for the form of the words used, and verbs to convert a script
in alpha form to a script in J primitives so there is no execution
time penalty.

The Image 3 package provides utilities for accessing 24-bit jpeg, png, bmp, tga and portable anymaps in J. The core functions allow reading and writing image files as 3-dimensional J arrays. The core jpeg and png utilities are accomplished using calls to the included dll. These external libraries are based on open source code.

The addon includes several scripts. The main script, image3.ijs, provides J functions for the basic image reading, writing,and image size either through library calls or directly defined J functions. Another script, html_gallery8.ijs, provides J functions that create thumbnails and image galleries under J program control. Sample scripts and a rotation form script are also included.
