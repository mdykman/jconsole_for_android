 <H1>Appendix 1: Evaluating Expressions</H1>
<H2>A1.1  Introduction</H2>
Here we look at the process of evaluating a J 
expression.
Evaluating a complete expression proceeds by a sequence 
of basic steps, 
such as obtaining the value assigned to a name,
or applying a function to its argument(s). For example, 
given 
<PRE>
   x =: 3
</PRE>
then the expression
<PRE>
   4+5*x
19
</PRE>
is (in outline) evaluated by the steps:
<OL>
<LI> obtain the value assigned to <TT>x</TT> giving <TT>3</TT>
<LI> compute <TT>5 * 3</TT> giving <TT>15</TT>
<LI> compute <TT>4 + 15</TT> giving <TT>19</TT>
</OL>
<p>
The sequence in which the steps take place is governed by 
the
grammatical (or "parsing") rules of the J language.  
The parsing rules have various consequences, or effects,
which can be stated informally, for example: 
<UL>
<LI> verbs have long right scope. For example, in the expression <TT>2 * 3 + 4</TT>
the right argument of <TT>*</TT> is <TT>3 + 4</TT> so that <TT>2 * 3 + 4</TT> means <TT> 2* (3 + 4)</TT>. 
This we earlier called the "rightmost-first" rule.
<LI> verbs have short left scope. For example in <TT>2 * 3 + 4</TT> the left argument
of <TT>+</TT> is <TT>3</TT>.
<LI> adverbs and conjunctions get applied before verbs. For example <TT>+ & 1 % 2</TT>
means <TT>(+ & 1 )% 2</TT>
<LI> adverbs and conjunctions have long left scope and 
short right scope
</UL>
These effects describe how an expression is implicitly parenthesized.
Of course, we can always produce desired effects by writing explicit parentheses,
even though they may not be needed.   Further effects are:
<UL> 
<LI> names denoting nouns are evaluated as soon as 
encountered
<LI> names denoting functions are not evaluated until the 
function is applied
<LI> names with no assigned values are assumed to denote 
verbs
<LI> long trains of verbs are resolved into trains of 
length 2 or 3
</UL>
and we will look at how the parsing rules give rise to 
these effects. 
To illustrate the process, we can use a function which 
models, 
or simulates, the evaluation process step by step, 
showing it at work in slow motion.  
This function, an adverb called <TT>EVM</TT>,is based on the 
description of the parsing
algorithm given in the J Dictionary, section IIE. It is 
defined in a  
<A HREF="91a.ijs">downloadable J script</A>.
<H2>A1.2  First Example</H2>
Evaluation of an expression such as <TT>2+3</TT> can be modelled 
by offering the 
argument <TT>'2+3'</TT> (a string, notice) to the modelling 
adverb <TT>EVM</TT>.
<p>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=1>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>2+3</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>'2+3' EVM</TT></TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><TT>5</TT></TD>
<TD><TT>5</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
<p>
We see that <TT>'2+3' EVM</TT> computes the same value as <TT>2+3</TT>,
 but <TT>EVM</TT> also produces a step-by-step record, or history,
of the evaluation process. 
This history is displayed by entering the expression 
<TT>hist ''</TT>
<PRE>
   hist ''

</PRE>
We see successive stages of the process. In this example there are
six stages.  
Each stage is defined by the values of two
variables. 
Firstly there is a "queue", initially containing the 
expression being evaluated, 
divided into words and preceded by a symbol to mark the 
beginning. 
Secondly, there is a "stack",
initially empty.  The first stage  shows queue and stack at the 
outset.
<p>
At each stage the stack is inspected to see if anything 
can be done, that is, whether
the first few words in the stack form a pattern to which 
a rule applies.  There are 9 of these rules,
and each one is tried in turn. 
If no rule applies, then a word is transferred from the 
tail of the queue to the head of the stack,
and we go to the next stage and try again. This process 
takes us from the first stage to the fifth stage. 
<p>
At the fifth stage, we find that a rule is applicable. This rule 
is identified as <TT>dyad</TT> in the rightmost column. Informally, the <TT>dyad</TT>
rule is:  
<p>
if the first four items in the stack
are something, noun, verb, noun, 
then apply verb to noun and noun to get new-noun, 
and replace the first four items in the stack by two, 
namely original-something followed by new-noun.  
<p>
The sixth and last stage shows the results of applying the "dyad" rule   
recognized at the previous stage. 
The rules are tried again, with no result, and there are 
no more words in the queue, 
so we have finished.  The final result is the second item 
of the stack.
The history is maintained in 3 global variables, <TT>Qh</TT> 
<TT>Sh</TT> and <TT>Rh</TT>.  
The expression <TT>hist ''</TT> computes a formatted display from these variables.
<H2>A1.3  Parsing Rules</H2>
In this section an example is shown of 
 each of 
the 9  parsing rules.
Each rule looks for a pattern of items at the front of the
  stack, 
such as something verb noun verb.
<p>
Each item of the stack is classified as one of the 
following: 
verb, noun, adverb, conjunction, name, 
left-parenthesis, right-parenthesis, assignment-symbol 
(<TT>=.</TT> or <TT>=:</TT>) or
beginning-mark.
<p>
To aid in a compact statement of the 
rules, larger classes of items
can be formed. 
For example, an item is classified as an "EDGE" if it is 
a beginning-mark, an assignment-symbol or
a left-parenthesis. 
<p>
The rules are always tried in the same order,
the order in which they are presented below,
beginning with the 'monad rule' and ending with the
'parenthesis rule'.
<p>
<H3>A1.3.1  Monad Rule</H3>
If the first 3 items of the stack are an "EDGE"
followed by a verb followed by a noun, then the verb is
applied (monadically) to the noun to give a result-value
symbolized by <TT>Z</TT> say, and the value <TT>Z</TT> replaces the verb
  and noun in the stack.
The scheme for transforming the items of the stack is: 
<PRE>
          monad rule: EDGE VERB NOUN etc  =>   EDGE Z etc
</PRE>
where <TT>Z</TT> is the result computed by applying <TT>VERB</TT> to 
<TT>NOUN</TT>.  For example:
<p>

 +---------+   +------+----+---+   +-----+ 
                                           
</PRE>
<H3>A1.3.2  Second Monad Rule</H3>
An item in the stack is classified as "EAVN" if it
is an EDGE or an adverb or verb or noun. The scheme is:
<PRE>
        monad2 rule: EAVN VERB1 VERB2 NOUN etc => EAVN VERB1 Z  etc
</PRE>
where <TT>Z</TT> is <TT>VERB2</TT> monadically applied to NOUN.  For

In the following example
the expression <TT>(1 &)</TT> is a bident of the form noun conjunction. 
Therefore it is an adverb.

By contrast, if the name is that of a verb, then the name 
is transferred into the 
stack without evaluating it.  Hence a subsequent assignment
changes the verb applied.

<H2>A1.4  Effects of Parsing Rules</H2>
Now we look at some of the effects,
 of the parsing rules.
In what follows, notice  
how the parsing rules in effect 
give rise to implicit parentheses.
<H3>A1.4.1  Dyad Has Long Right Scope</H3>
Consider the expression <TT>4+3-2</TT>, which means <TT>4+(3-2)</TT>.

</PRE>
Here we have an example of a general rule: a dyadic verb 
takes as its right argument
as much as possible, so in this example <TT>+</TT> is applied to 
<TT>3-2</TT>, not just <TT>3</TT>.
<p>
Further, a dyadic verb takes as left argument as little as
 possible. In this example
the left argument of <TT>-</TT> is just <TT>3</TT>, not <TT>4+3</TT>.  Hence a 
dyadic verb is said to have a 
"long right scope" and a "short left scope".
<H3>A1.4.2  Operators Before Verbs</H3>
Adverbs and conjunctions get applied first, and then the 
resulting verbs:

<H3>A1.4.3  Operators Have Long Left Scope</H3>
In the following examples, note that  
values of verbs are  shown in the "parenthesized representation" (see <A HREF="27.htm">Chapter 27</A>)
to show their structure. 
<p>
An adverb or a conjunction takes as its left argument as 
much as possible.
Look  at the structure of these verbs: 
evidently
the <TT>/</TT> adverb and the <TT>@</TT> conjunction take everything to 
their left:

Thus operators are said to have a "long left scope". 
 In the example of
<TT>f&g@h</TT> we see that the right argument of <TT>&</TT> is just <TT>g</TT>,
 not <TT>g@h</TT> .
Thus conjunctions have "short right scope".
<H3>A1.4.4  Train on the Left</H3>
The long left scope of an adverb does
not extend through a train: parentheses
may be needed to get the desired effect.
Suppose <TT>f g h</TT> is intended as a train, then compare the 
following:
