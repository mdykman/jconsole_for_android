J for C Programmers<hr><!--top jump end--><div class=Section1><h1 style='mso-list:none;tab-stops:.5in .75in 1.0in 1.25in 1.5in 1.75in 2.0in'><a

style='mso-bookmark:_Toc5414373'><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc191734286'>Foreword</span></span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>You are an experienced C programmer who has heard about J,
and you think you'd like to see what it's all about.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Congratulations!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>You have made a decision that will change
your programming life, if only you see it through.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this book is to help you do
that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It won't be easy, and it certainly won't be what you're
expecting.&nbsp; You've learned languages
before, and you know the drill: find out how variables are declared, learn the
syntax for conditionals and loops, learn how to call a function, get a couple
of examples to edit, and you're a coder.&nbsp;
Fuggeddaboutit!&nbsp; In J, there are
no declarations, seldom will you see a loop, and conditionals often go
incognito.&nbsp; As for coding from examples,
well, most of our examples are only a couple of lines of code--you won't get
much momentum from that!&nbsp; You're just
going to have to grit your teeth and learn a completely new way to write
programs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Why should you bother?&nbsp;
To begin with, for the productivity.&nbsp;
J programs are usually a fifth to a tenth as long as corresponding C
programs, and along with that economy of expression comes coding speed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Next, for the programming environment: J is
an interpreted language, so your programs will never crash, you can modify code
while it's running, you don't have to deal with makefiles and linking, and you
can test your code simply by entering it at the keyboard and seeing what it
does.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>If you stick with it, J won't just help the way you code,
it'll help the way you think.&nbsp; C is a
computer language; it lets you control the things the computer does.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>J is a language of computation: it lets you
describe what needs to be done without getting bogged down in details (but in
those details, the efficiency of its algorithms is extraordinary).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Because J expressions deal with large blocks
of data, you will stop thinking of individual numbers and start thinking at a
larger scale.&nbsp; Confronted with a problem,
you will immediately break it down into pieces of the proper size and express
the solution in J--and if you can express the problem, you have a J program, and
your problem is solved.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Unfortunately, it seems to be the case that the more
experience you have as a C programmer, the less likely you are to switch to
J.&nbsp; This may not be because prolonged
exposure to C code limits your vision<!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-begin'></span> XE &quot;C:belittled&quot; <![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]--><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>and contracts the scope of your thinking to
the size of a 32-bit word--though studies to check that are still under way and
it might be wise for you to stop before it's too late--but because the better
you are at C, the more you have to lose by switching to J.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>You have developed a number of coding habits:
for example, how to manage loops to avoid errors at extreme cases; how to
manage pointers effectively; how to use type-checking to avoid errors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>None of that will be applicable to J.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>J <i>will</i> take advantage of your skill in
grasping the essence of a problem--indeed, it will develop that skill
considerably by making it easier for you to express what you grasp--but you will
go through a period during which it will seem like it takes forever to get
things done.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>During that period, please remember that to justify your
choice of J, you don't have to be as expert in J as you were in C; you only
have to be more productive in J than you were in C.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>That might well happen within a month.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>After you have fully learned J, it will
usually be your first choice for describing a program.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Becoming a J programmer doesn't mean you'll have to give
up C completely; every language has its place.&nbsp;
In the cases where you want to write code in C (either to use a library
you have in C or to write a DLL for a function that is inefficiently computed
in J), you will find interfacing J to DLLs to be simple and effective.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This book's goal is to explain rudimentary J using
language familiar to a C programmer.&nbsp;
After you finish reading it, you should do yourself the honor of
carefully reading the J Dictionary, in which you can learn the full language,
one of the great creations in computer science and mathematics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:.5in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>I am obliged to the reviewers who commented on earlier versions: Terrence
Brannon, Michel Dumontier, Ken Iverson, Fraser
 Jackson, June Kim, David Ness, Richard Payne, John Randall, Ewart
Shaw, and Keith Smillie.&nbsp; Brian Schott,
Nicholas Spies, and Norman Thomson exchanged emails with me at length to smooth
over rough spots.&nbsp; David Steele conducted
a painstaking review of several early drafts and suggested many changes great
and small.&nbsp; Bjorn Helgason translated the
text into Icelandic, finding a number of errors along the way.<span

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;Kip Murray's 'review'
became more of a dismantling, cleaning, and reassembly operation in which large
sections of prose were rewritten as he pointed out to me their essential
meaninglessness; the reader should be as grateful to him as I am.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Without the patient explanations of my early teachers in
J, Raul Miller and Martin Neitzel, I would have given up on J.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I hope that this book pays to others the debt
I owe to them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>My current happy career as a J programmer would not have
been possible without the work of the staff at Jsoftware, Inc., who created
J.&nbsp; For the patriarch, the late Ken
Iverson, I am unworthy to express admiration: I have only awe.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I hope his achievement eases the lives of
programmers for generations to come.&nbsp; To
the rest, both Iversons and non-Iversons, I give my thanks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The implementation of the J interpreter has required
diverse skills: architectural vision, careful selection of algorithms,
cold-eyed project management to select features for implementation, robust and
efficient coding, performance optimization, and expertise in numerical
analysis.&nbsp; Most improbably, all these
talents have resided in one man, Roger Hui <i>il miglior fabbro</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>J gives us all a way to have a little of
Roger's code in our own.&nbsp; We should
aspire no higher.</p>
