DTRSYL solves the real Sylvester matrix equation:

   op(A)*X + X*op(B) = scale*C or

   op(A)*X - X*op(B) = scale*C,


where op(A) = A or A**T, and  A and B are both upper quasi-
triangular. A is M-by-M and B is N-by-N; the right hand side C and the
solution X are M-by-N; and scale is an output scale factor, set <= 1
to avoid overflow in X.


A and B must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that
is, block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks;
each 2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.


Arguments
=========

TRANA   (input) CHARACTER*1
        Specifies the option op(A):

        = 'N': op(A) = A    (No transpose)

        = 'T': op(A) = A**T (Transpose)

        = 'C': op(A) = A**H (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

TRANB   (input) CHARACTER*1

        Specifies the option op(B):

        = 'N': op(B) = B    (No transpose)

        = 'T': op(B) = B**T (Transpose)

        = 'C': op(B) = B**H (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

ISGN    (input) INTEGER

        Specifies the sign in the equation:

        = +1: solve op(A)*X + X*op(B) = scale*C

        = -1: solve op(A)*X - X*op(B) = scale*C

M       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A, and the number of rows in the
        matrices X and C. M >= 0.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix B, and the number of columns in the
        matrices X and C. N >= 0.

A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,M)
        The upper quasi-triangular matrix A, in Schur canonical form.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).

B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,N)
        The upper quasi-triangular matrix B, in Schur canonical form.

LDB     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).

C       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDC,N)
        On entry, the M-by-N right hand side matrix C.
        On exit, C is overwritten by the solution matrix X.

LDC     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M)

SCALE   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        The scale factor, scale, set <= 1 to avoid overflow in X.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0: successful exit

        < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        = 1: A and B have common or very close eigenvalues; perturbed
        values were used to solve the equation (but the matrices
        A and B are unchanged).
