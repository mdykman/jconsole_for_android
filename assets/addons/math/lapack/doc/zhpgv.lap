ZHPGV computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors
of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x. Here A and B
are assumed to be Hermitian, stored in packed format, and B is also
positive definite.


Arguments
=========

ITYPE   (input) INTEGER
        Specifies the problem type to be solved:

        = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x

        = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x

        = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x

JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1

        = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;

        = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1

        = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

AP      (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
        On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
        A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
        is stored in the array AP as follows:
        if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
        if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

        On exit, the contents of AP are destroyed.

BP      (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
        On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
        B, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of B
        is stored in the array BP as follows:
        if UPLO = 'U', BP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = B(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
        if UPLO = 'L', BP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = B(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

        On exit, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
        factorization B = U**H*U or B = L*L**H, in the same storage
        format as B.

W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

Z       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ, N)
        If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
        eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
        if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**H*B*Z = I;
        if ITYPE = 3, Z**H*inv(B)*Z = I.
        If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.

LDZ     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
        JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).

WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (max(1, 2*N-1))


RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(1, 3*N-2))


INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  ZPPTRF or ZHPEV returned an error code:

        <= N:  if INFO = i, ZHPEV failed to converge;
        i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
        tridiagonal form did not convergeto zero;
        > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= n, then the leading
        minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
        The factorization of B could not be completed and
        no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
