ZHPTRD reduces a complex Hermitian matrix A stored in packed form to
real symmetric tridiagonal form T by a unitary similarity
transformation: Q**H * A * Q = T.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

AP      (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
        On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
        A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
        is stored in the array AP as follows:
        if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
        if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
        On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
        of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
        tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
        superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the unitary
        matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
        = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
        written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
        matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
        the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a product
        of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.

D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
        D(i) = A(i,i).

E       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
        The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
        E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.

TAU     (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
        The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
        Details).

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value


Further Details
===============

If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
reflectors


   Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).


Each H(i) has the form


   H(i) = I - tau * v * v'


where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with v(i+1:n)
= 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in AP, overwriting
A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau is stored in TAU(i).


If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
reflectors


   Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).


Each H(i) has the form


   H(i) = I - tau * v * v'


where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with v(1:i) =
0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in AP, overwriting
A(i+2:n,i), and tau is stored in TAU(i).
