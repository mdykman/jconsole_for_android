DGEESX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
eigenvalues, the real Schur form T, and, optionally, the matrix of
Schur vectors Z.  This gives the Schur factorization A = Z*T*(Z**T).

Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues on the diagonal of the real
Schur form so that selected eigenvalues are at the top left; computes
a reciprocal condition number for the average of the selected
eigenvalues (RCONDE); and computes a reciprocal condition number for
the right invariant subspace corresponding to the selected eigenvalues
(RCONDV).  The leading columns of Z form an orthonormal basis for this
invariant subspace.


For further explanation of the reciprocal condition numbers RCONDE and
RCONDV, see Section 4.10 of the LAPACK Users' Guide (where these
quantities are called s and sep respectively).


A real matrix is in real Schur form if it is upper quasi-triangular
with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks. 2-by-2 blocks will be standardized in
the form

          [  a  b  ]

          [  c  a  ]


where b*c < 0. The eigenvalues of such a block are a +- sqrt(bc).


Arguments
=========

JOBVS   (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'N': Schur vectors are not computed;

        = 'V': Schur vectors are computed.

SORT    (input) CHARACTER*1
        Specifies whether or not to order the eigenvalues on the
        diagonal of the Schur form.
        = 'N': Eigenvalues are not ordered;

        = 'S': Eigenvalues are ordered (see SELECT).

SELECT  (input) LOGICAL FUNCTION of two DOUBLE PRECISION arguments
        SELECT must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling subroutine.
        If SORT = 'S', SELECT is used to select eigenvalues to sort
        to the top left of the Schur form.
        If SORT = 'N', SELECT is not referenced.
        An eigenvalue WR(j)+sqrt(-1)*WI(j) is selected if
        SELECT(WR(j),WI(j)) is true; i.e., if either one of a
        complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues is selected, then both
        are.  Note that a selected complex eigenvalue may no longer
        satisfy SELECT(WR(j),WI(j)) = .TRUE. after ordering, since
        ordering may change the value of complex eigenvalues
        (especially if the eigenvalue is ill-conditioned); in this
        case INFO may be set to N+3 (see INFO below).

SENSE   (input) CHARACTER*1
        Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
        = 'N': None are computed;

        = 'E': Computed for average of selected eigenvalues only;

        = 'V': Computed for selected right invariant subspace only;

        = 'B': Computed for both.
        If SENSE = 'E', 'V' or 'B', SORT must equal 'S'.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.

A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
        On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
        On exit, A is overwritten by its real Schur form T.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

SDIM    (output) INTEGER
        If SORT = 'N', SDIM = 0.
        If SORT = 'S', SDIM = number of eigenvalues (after sorting)
        for which SELECT is true. (Complex conjugate
        pairs for which SELECT is true for either
        eigenvalue count as 2.)

WR      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)


WI      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively,
        of the computed eigenvalues, in the same order that they
        appear on the diagonal of the output Schur form T.  Complex
        conjugate pairs of eigenvalues appear consecutively with the
        eigenvalue having the positive imaginary part first.

VS      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVS,N)
        If JOBVS = 'V', VS contains the orthogonal matrix Z of Schur
        vectors.
        If JOBVS = 'N', VS is not referenced.

LDVS    (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array VS.  LDVS >= 1, and if
        JOBVS = 'V', LDVS >= N.

RCONDE  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', RCONDE contains the reciprocal
        condition number for the average of the selected eigenvalues.
        Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'V'.

RCONDV  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', RCONDV contains the reciprocal
        condition number for the selected right invariant subspace.
        Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'E'.

WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LWORK)
        On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

LWORK   (input) INTEGER
        The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N).
        Also, if SENSE = 'E' or 'V' or 'B',
        LWORK >= N+2*SDIM*(N-SDIM), where SDIM is the number of
        selected eigenvalues computed by this routine.  Note that
        N+2*SDIM*(N-SDIM) <= N+N*N/2.
        For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.

IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (LIWORK)
        Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'E'.

LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
        The dimension of the array IWORK.
        LIWORK >= 1; if SENSE = 'V' or 'B', LIWORK >= SDIM*(N-SDIM).

BWORK   (workspace) LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
        Not referenced if SORT = 'N'.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0: successful exit

        < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

        > 0: if INFO = i, and i is

        <= N: the QR algorithm failed to compute all the

        eigenvalues; elements 1:ILO-1 and i+1:N of WR and WI
        contain those eigenvalues which have converged; if
        JOBVS = 'V', VS contains the transformation which
        reduces A to its partially converged Schur form.
        = N+1: the eigenvalues could not be reordered because some
        eigenvalues were too close to separate (the problem
        is very ill-conditioned);
        = N+2: after reordering, roundoff changed values of some
        complex eigenvalues so that leading eigenvalues in
        the Schur form no longer satisfy SELECT=.TRUE.  This
        could also be caused by underflow due to scaling.
