ZHETRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
Hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or A =
L*D*L**H computed by ZHETRF.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
        as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
        = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;

        = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

NRHS    (input) INTEGER
        The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
        of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

A       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
        The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
        obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZHETRF.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
        Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
        as determined by ZHETRF.

B       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
        On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
        On exit, the solution matrix X.

LDB     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
