DPPEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
symmetric positive definite matrix A in packed storage and reduce its
condition number (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale
factors, S(i)=1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
elements B(i,j)=S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal. This choice
of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the smallest
possible condition number over all possible diagonal scalings.


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

AP      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
        The upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix A, packed
        columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
        in the array AP as follows:
        if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
        if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.

SCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
        the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
        large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.

AMAX    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
        close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
        should be scaled.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.
