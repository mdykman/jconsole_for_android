ZPPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite packed matrix using
the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by
ZPPTRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).


Arguments
=========

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

        = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
        The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
        A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, packed columnwise in a linear
        array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the array AP
        as follows:
        if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
        if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
        The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the Hermitian matrix A.

RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
        The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
        computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
        estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)


RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)


INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
