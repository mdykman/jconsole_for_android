DPTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix by first factoring the
matrix using DPTTRF, and then calling DBDSQR to compute the singular
values of the bidiagonal factor.

This routine computes the eigenvalues of the positive definite
tridiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy.  This means that if the
eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude in size, then the
small eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will be computed more
accurately than, for example, with the standard QR method.

The eigenvectors of a full or band symmetric positive definite matrix
can also be found if DSYTRD, DSPTRD, or DSBTRD has been used to reduce
this matrix to tridiagonal form. (The reduction to tridiagonal form,
however, may preclude the possibility of obtaining high relative
accuracy in the small eigenvalues of the original matrix, if these
eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude.)


Arguments
=========

COMPZ   (input) CHARACTER*1
        = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.

        = 'V':  Compute eigenvectors of original symmetric
        matrix also.  Array Z contains the orthogonal
        matrix used to reduce the original matrix to
        tridiagonal form.
        = 'I':  Compute eigenvectors of tridiagonal matrix also.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.

D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal
        matrix.
        On normal exit, D contains the eigenvalues, in descending
        order.

E       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
        On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
        matrix.
        On exit, E has been destroyed.

Z       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, N)
        On entry, if COMPZ = 'V', the orthogonal matrix used in the
        reduction to tridiagonal form.
        On exit, if COMPZ = 'V', the orthonormal eigenvectors of the
        original symmetric matrix;
        if COMPZ = 'I', the orthonormal eigenvectors of the
        tridiagonal matrix.
        If INFO > 0 on exit, Z contains the eigenvectors associated
        with only the stored eigenvalues.
        If  COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.

LDZ     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
        COMPZ = 'V' or 'I', LDZ >= max(1,N).

WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LWORK)
        If  COMPZ = 'N', then LWORK = 2*N
        If  COMPZ = 'V' or 'I', then LWORK = MAX(1,4*N-4)

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit.

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

        > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is:
        <= N  the Cholesky factorization of the matrix could
        not be performed because the i-th principal minor
        was not positive definite.
        > N   the SVD algorithm failed to converge;
        if INFO = N+i, i off-diagonal elements of the
        bidiagonal factor did not converge to zero.
